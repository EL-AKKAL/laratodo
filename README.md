# laratodo
my first laravel real life project
in order to practice what i learned until now i have created a small todo project.

- this project is a simple CRUD system with a simple beautiful design.
- it contains no seed for database .
- by finishing this project i have mastered the CRUD operations with no database relationships
- next project will be more advanced .
